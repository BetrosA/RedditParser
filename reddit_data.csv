As you all may know by now, Uber and Lyft have become quite common as apps that replaced Taxis for the most part in major cities and towns as a way to get a ride, and it's a service provided by individual contractors like myself who use a different app as the ride provider to earn an income or sometimes it is marketed as a way to have a ""side hustle"" to make more income on top of a main job.

I want to share my personal horror stories as a driver and user of these apps as well as offer some incite to other drivers out there on the road. I hope we can all learn from my experiences.

For starters, I'm an actor in Los Angeles so instead of waiting tables or trying to be a bartender, (or turning to prostitution for that matter), I decided to make an income through ride share driving to get myself some flexibility to my schedule for acting auditions (usually at short notice).

Story 1: Early days of Rideshare Driving.

Initially I had my own used 2002 Volkswagen Passat, and it was a car I grew up with and loved and it was very reliable. I signed up solely with Uber at first and in the early days of the app when they gave out incentives and ""rush hour"" bonuses. In the early days it was very hard to make any money driving the app unless you specifically targeted those large 2x and sometimes 7x earning bonuses. Based on my miles per gallon on my Volkswagen I was actually only making about 3 dollars per hour during most of the day due to the infrequent rides, due to my gas cost, and due to the fact that Uber took a large portion of my earnings per ride. And at that time if I drove during the busy rush hours to catch bonuses, I earned about 20 dollars per hour or sometimes even 30 depending on traffic and how fast I can dodge through it to get another ride with a massive bonus. Of course this wasn't healthy for the long run and it was VERY HARD to earn a steady income and caused a LOT of stress due to having to drive during rush hour traffic in downtown LA to even earn something close to a minimum wage job on average since rush hour only lasted about 2-3 hours each day and the rest of the day it's very hard to get any customers other than the early adopters.

Lesson 1: What I learned during this time is to look at the formula of how we got paid, and to calculate my own gas costs, (also taxes!) to see just how much am I actually earning per hour and to look for ways to lower my own costs down and make more money. I found that the best practice is to turn on the app but park my car somewhere in a decently busy area when I'm in between rides instead of driving around burning gas looking for new rides. This significantly lowered my gas costs down and I am also reducing traffic by doing this! I allowed the App to look for rides and nearby customers for me and I drove a lot less. Think of in between rides as breaks...

Lesson 2: There's a pattern to when there's more demand for rides and I found different times to be on the road that worked for me. It didn't have to be rush hour traffic in 5PM LA, it could be also early mornings when people were waking up to go to work early in the morning, or going to the airport! And it was VERY profitable to pick up long rides back then as it reduced the time between waiting for new rides and I earned a lot more whenever I found these longer rides!

Story 2: Car Problems and the disgusting business called Fair.

My Volkswagen eventually started breaking down and having problems, this happened repeated over the course of 2 years with me having to repeatedly pay large sums to fix my car and at first it was just to change the car batteries, and small expenses... but then soon it started to get really crazy with timing belt changes, and then when the car overheated from a coolant leak that (suspiciously happened immediately after I had an oil change done by a shady mechanic) I had damage to the engine from the overheating... and that was when I knew, fixing my car wasn't going to be worth it... I started eating parking tickets for ""abandoned vehicle"" which also doubled several times because I didn't know that my car would get ticketed for even being parked... and a long story short I couldn't pay $2000 to fix the car when it was my main source of income and I couldn't sell it since it was broken, and I had to junk it.

In comes my idea to rent a vehicle instead! Haha, that might have sounded like a smart idea at the time, and it was also at the time when Fair partnered up with Uber to offer rental cars. I tried to get a car from Fair and this is what happened:

Initially I called Fair support to see when I can get to pick up the vehicle I wanted... a nice little orange 2016 Toyota Prius with barely 9000 miles on it. They told me the car was in San Diego... Keep in mind I don't have a car at this point and I lived in Los Angeles. I asked them if they could deliver it to me and they told me yes, but at this point Uber has my address as Glendale, which was a while ago when I first signed up with Uber, and of course as an actor who barely lives rent to rent, I had to move around quite often, so this was no longer my current address at the time. I told the Fair support that that was not my address and that I lived in Chatsworth... well that was a disaster, because they told me because my address is no longer up to date, I can't get the car delivered to me by the Fair Concierge team... and ooook? SO what do you want me to do, Fair? They told me to change my address with them, and I went ""ok great! let's do that"" but Fair Support doesn't have the authorization to change the address on my Fair account... NO... that's something only the Fair Concierge team can do for me and they are only accessible through first calling the Fair Support team on their support line... waiting between 30 minutes to 2 hours on the phone for someone to pick up, tell them to transfer me to the Fair Concierge team so I can change my address, then waiting another 2 hours or so for the Fair Concierge team to pick up the phone and talk about changing my Address with them. And here's how THAT interaction went:

a. They told me I needed to provide proof of address... and again as an actor who moved around a lot, I typically sublet a single room and have no utility bills and no pay stubs to use since hey guess what, I'm an UBER DRIVER. This is a conversation after 2-3 hours waiting between Fair Support, then transferring to Fair Concierge....

b. I called repeatedly asking them to change my address, I literally stood outside my new address with my phone and took pictures of me next to the mailbox number... and held up a sign with the street name, and they told me they can't accept that... so I had to try MANY different times calling them to see if this works, no? Ok how about this other thing I got in the mail? NO? Could somebody please give me a LIST of the acceptable proof of address documents?! OH ok finally... and after much trying and dialing and waiting for literally DAYS worth of time on the phone, I got someone who gave me a very helpful suggestion, That I take an UBER ride as a rider down to San Diego to the car to pick it up and that Fair offers to pay for up to 100 miles worth of Uber ride to go pick up the vehicle... well great... I thanked the man for his offer and took him up on it, but it turns out it was 200 miles between Los Angeles and San Diego so that meant that I had to get TWO 100 mile long Uber rides and only 1 of them could be covered by the company called... Fair (this name is getting ironic, but wait... there's more)

c. Not only did I have to pay out of pocket for my second 100 mile ride to pick up the car in San Diego, but the first 100 mile ride was ""paid for"" by Fair in the form of a gift card... yes.. a gift card which I could only use at select stores such as Nordstroms, Banana Republic, Gap, Old Navy, etc... I don't know what gave them the impression that a guy who drives Uber for a living would need to shop at Banana Republic and how a gift card for Banana Republic is in any way a form of compensation for hundreds of dollars worth of UBER rides down to pick up a rental car that they were supposed to deliver to me completely free if they didn't have an asinine Change of Address Policy that also includes ""You can't change your address with Fair unless you have been renting from Fair for at least 40 days""... so it was a perpetual catch 22, since I can't get it delivered to me if I don't have an up to date address, AND I can't change said address without having had rented a car from Fair for 40 days... This should have been a red flag from the get go, but I was getting pretty desperate since I needed a vehicle to not only drive for Uber, but I needed a vehicle to get anywhere period, and not only was I running out of savings fast, but I also had to get a reliable way to get to auditions... and at this point I was taking the metroline and buses and it would take like a 6 hour round trip to get to auditions downtown from Chatsworth by bus... it was insanity and I really really needed a car... so I here I was... Fair has me cornered, despite their nonsensical policies... SO I picked up my Fair vehicle which I found out didn't belong to Fair, but an actual car dealership doing this program with Fair... so... essentially Fair has no capital invested... they have a contractual agreement with car dealerships to rent their cars, and then they have an agreement with Uber to rent cars to Uber drivers that Uber approves of... and so all they do is B2B service and their service is GOD AWFUL? I should have known better, but hindsight is 20/20 and all that...

So I got my car from Fair, and the car was really nice! I drove it 200 miles back to where I lived so that the round trip cost me upwards of $200 in gas and Uber trip costs... I got a car that I had to make an immediate down payment for and my first month's car rental cost as well, and on top of that and I got a 100 dollar gift card to freakin Banana Republic... great... let's get started with my Actual experiences driving with Fair shall we?

The Fair Rental price for my car was a little over 800 dollars per month for the car which includes their Fair Insurance for the car. Except it wasn't a month to month agreement, it was weekly. SO every WEEK I had to pay 200 dollars to Fair for insurance and car rental. Ok that meant that on top of my gas costs (which was thankfully low due to me driving that Prius and stopping on the side of the road between rides) I had to pay 200 bucks every week out of what I was making as an Uber Driver... at that point I was making on average 100 dollars a day (not taking into account gas and taxes I'll have to pay), so actually with all things considered for every 100 dollars I made I had to pay 20 dollars in gas and a bit of taxes as well as income tax, so for a 10 hour work day as an Uber Driver I was making roughly 60 bucks a day. I was working EVERY DAY and driving about 10 hours a day in the hostile Los Angeles traffic, and it was a living hell... I started struggling with depression and anxiety after the first assault by a rider (which I will go into after this story with Fair), and things kept getting out of hand and it was like I had to put out fires left and right.

In any case, I was barely surviving at this point and about 2 months into driving this Prius that I rented from Fair, I got a notice on my Uber app telling me that in a month my car registration would expire. I immediately called Fair Support (waiting the typical 30 minutes to 2 hours on the phone queue like a solid American), to tell them that I needed my Fair vehicle insurance to be updated and sent to me ASAP. I was told I would get the registration in the mail within 5-7 business days... two weeks later it still didn't happen, so I called them again (waiting for another 2 hours on the phone queue), and they said that I should be patient at wait... so I waited and three days before the expiration of my car registration I called yet again... and got the same response... please wait... so I did, and after my car registration DID expire, the Uber app locked me out of being able to drive for Uber, since I had an expired car registration. Great... I couldn't work for money... but wait there more! I was still getting charged 200 dollars a week for the Fair vehicle WITH NO REGISTRATION. I called them AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN practically once a day (one time I actually had to wait for 6 hours on the phone since registration is not handled by Fair Support but by Fair Concierge and Fair Concierge is only accessed by first calling Fair Support, waiting the god awful 2 hours then transferring over to Fair Concierge and waiting for another 2 eternities to get to speak with a human... but this one time I waited 6 hours...) And finally after 4 weeks... I got my new Fair Registration and new license plates for my vehicles... and I had to pay for all 4 weeks according to this company called... wait for it... FAIR. They told me that this was indeed unfair when I called them out on it and they did what again??? You guessed it... another Banana Republic gift card that can't be used to pay Rent, can't be used to pay for Gas, and can't be used to pay for my Fair Car Rental... so it does butt fuck nothing (excuse my Americanism), unless I needed some fancy clothes in a real hurry.

SO at this point I'm severely in debt and I had a maxed out credit card, and moving forward I worked 12 hour shifts, was constantly suicidal and needed my agent to submit me to an actual audition which she hasn't done for over 8 months at that point... and of course in LA anytime you call your agent to speak with them they say ""I'm too busy right now""... shit got real (excuse my Americanism).

A few months later, I spoke with my parents about potentially getting help from them to pay a down payment for a car so that I can start financing my own car and pay a lot less each month towards buying my own car, than what I was paying for an UNFAIR company's vehicle.

My mother actually flew over to where I lived in LA and she fronted me the down payment to my brand new 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid... and I negotiated with the dealership to get my monthly payments down to about 400 dollars a month. That was half of what I was paying Fair... and this time around this is my OWN car that I'll be paying towards instead of just a rental.

Well... This makes sense then to return my Fair Vehicle right? Yeah... you can already anticipate the stress can't you? But wait, there's more!

Not only did it take a long time for Fair Concierge to come pick up the car... (adding another extra two weeks that I had to pay for the car), but once they picked it up, they continued to charge me weekly for a vehicle I no longer had... I called repeated for Fair to stop charging me but they didn't stop charging me and said it was ""included in my contract"" that I had to keep paying for Fair even after returning my vehicle. I nearly thought of finding the nearest Fair company location and shooting up the place. But calmer reasoning took over and I decided to simply take this to the law. I went to Court and got all the paperwork necessary to file a Small Claims against the Fair Company. I then was told that in order to serve them and press charges against them, I have to first give them FAIR WARNING ahead of time... SO I called them repeatedly (you know... again and again.. 5 hour phone queues to speak with the correct department who can actually DO something), and then finally I gave up and emailed them instead because I needed evidence for court that I actually contacted them and notified them that if they didn't stop charging me I'm taking this to a court of law. Well, they didn't stop, but I tried something else. I called my bank. I told them about the whole situation and how I want to dispute all charges made to my account by Fair since the date when I returned my vehicle. AND I wanted to dispute all charges made to my account by Fair for the four weeks I didn't have an up to date car registration. My bank's fraud department was on my side for this and helped me out with disputing all these charges and refunding me about $1000 dollars. I provided them with all the necessary documentation including screenshots of my Uber App dates when I didn't work due to the car registration issue, the dates on my car registration both old and new. I have EVERY legal piece of evidence to win my case in court and I knew it.

And once this happened the shoe was on the other foot (so to speak in Americanism) because Fair Support started to call me for money almost 24/7. I got a kick out of that one because I left a very special voice mail response and purposefully ignored all unknown calls. I won't give you my voicemail response on here but needless to say, any Fair representative got a taste of the FAIR support treatment, and was properly served legally that ""I will take you to court if you want to pursue this further, and I have all the evidence to win the case"".

Eventually the calls from Fair dwindled down to maybe once in a month and I'd laugh at their face when they told me they worked for Fair. Sorry but you guys deserve to be mocked... Fair company if you see this, FUCK YOU (excuse my Americanism).

Lesson 3: Do NOT ever, and I mean EVER rent a vehicle from Fair. They are UNFAIR, have shit service, long phone queues of upwards of 6 hours if you need to talk to someone who can actually change your address or do anything to your account with them... and they charge you even after you've returned your vehicle because ""it's in the contract"" ... yeah don't ever rent from Fair. EVER. Let this business rot in hell.

Story 3: I got assaulted in my vehicle two separate occasions as an Uber Driver

So... around February of 2019 I drove on the super bowl weekend and the team in LA apparently lost (sorry I don't follow sports... I'm more of an esports kinda guy), and I heard about it all night while driving Uber. I've already had my fair share of drunk people as a driver and I was used to it at this time and I get a lot of rides at night on weekends just like this one or so I thought...

I pulled up to a house to pick some guy up named Bob. Bob and his friend came to my car... and well, let's just say Bob is probably over 500 lbs because it took him 10 minutes to squeeze/wedge/slam/shove himself through the door of my car, took up the entire backseat with his butt and made the entire car sink down with his weight. His friend in comparison is your healthy average American of 200 lb beer belly kinda guy. They were both drunk and talking about football and I tuned them out to drive as per usual.

Then about 5 minutes into the ride, Bob fell asleep in the back of my car and woke up confused and upset and asked ""Where are you taking me?"" in a panicked tone of voice. His friend reassured him ""we're going to the hotel, Bob, relax!"" But Bob wouldn't have any of it, no, you see, BOB here thought I might have been abducting him to prove aliens existed ... or something. I'm not a mind reader ok? But he then decided the best response was to start groping me, placing both his hands on my chest. I'm a guy... but still... don't touch my nipples??? I do NOT give consent!

Well, I asked him politely or as politely as I could manage, ""sir, would you mind not touching me please?"" His friend looked over his shoulder at him and went ""What are you doing, Bob? It's ok, just relax"".

Bob reacted in anger. He didn't like being told what to do. He didn't like that he doesn't just get to grope his Uber driver. So Bob did what he thought was best, to show people how strong he was. Bob grabbed my seat belt from behind me with both hands and started to strangle me.

I was at this point driving on the 118 high way and I was going around 55 miles per hour. I started to see stars, and I tried desperately to free my airway while maintaining control of my car (This was the orange toyota Prius I was renting from Fair). I thought in my mind, ""Oh shit, so this is how it ends... how undignified"".... and I was almost about to pass out but I got some more circulation because Bob's friend was helping me pull the seatbelt down... I also pulled down so that instead of it being on my neck it was on my collarbone, and I could breath again but barely, the seatbelt was pressed against my collar bone with enough force to feel like I was in a major car accident, except Bob kept crushing it against me by leaning back with it and pulling with his weight. I thought about pulling over... even just abandoning the vehicle to run for my life... but instead I was in a state of shock and drove them to their destination which was a hotel...

Uber had another customer lined up for me... so I took the next rider in a slightly dazed and confused state... I was probably not safe to drive at that point but I wasn't even really aware... I was kind of on auto pilot at that point, but I told the next drunk passenger what happened, and she said she was the wife of a cop, and that I should call the cops immediately. So after I dropped HER off I called 911, and the police came to where I lived and got my report, and took pictures of my now bruised collarbone and neck area. I was asked if I wanted to press charges and I said I did, and they told me I'd hear from the District Attorney's office in about 3 weeks.

I waited... Nothing ... The DA's office never reached out to me...

I was depressed and had PTSD from this incident and it was so bad that I couldn't go out the next day to get back to work as an Uber Driver. I couldn't go out to work the day after that... nor the next week... I had to take a full month off. My roommates (one of whom was the house mom sorta, and was rather Jewish in both descent and behavior) instead of showing sympathy or being compassionate was trying to evict me or threatening to since I was late on rent, and I had to call my mom to help me at the time with rent.

I tried to work up the courage to drive again, but for that whole month the best I could do was sit in my car and cry.

And guess what? Wouldn't you know it... because wait... there's more.

The very first night I started to feel better enough to go drive again... the very first customer that night, was a drunk guy... who held a switch blade to my throat.

Yup... it went something like this... he got in... he asked where I'm from in a friendly tone... both him and his friend were drunk off their ass and having a good time. I told him I'm from the Bay Area from northern california and they said ""NorCal? You better not say Hella"". I'm like, ""Ok, sure thing, I won't say Hella"" because I suppose it's a bit of a stereotype that Northern Californians like to say ""hella"" like ""oh that's Hella cool man!"" for extra emphasis. And I took it in stride and laughed and said I won't say hella if it bothered him, and actually I don't say it that often anymore anyways since I've been living in LA for acting.

But then he pulled out his switch blade and held it to my throat. ""Don't fucking say hella"".

""I won't dude.""

""Don't you fucking say it! I'm warning you!""

""I won't say it...""

I just kept driving, hands on the wheel, eyes on the road... my heart actually stopped dead at one point. My mind was just a total blank.

This guy literally drops his knife on seat next to me on his way out of my car when I dropped him off... I looked at him and asked him to ""please remove your knife from my car"" and nodded to it... I could have driven off with it as evidence... but I just... was done at this point. He looked at the knife then back at me... then paused and realized at that moment what he just did. I waited for what seemed like 10 minutes as he stood there eyeing me...

I mean, I actually wasn't scared for my life this time. Not because I wasn't in any danger, but he was drunk and thought this whole time that this was a joke and that he was using his knife for emphasis. That was what my read on the situation was, and that was why I wasn't driving away in a panic. I wasn't scared for my life in that moment, and I just wanted to be done with him...

He took his knife from my car and closed the door, and tipped me on the app. I drove off. And didn't drive for another week. But I was financially destitute and in debt and living off of food stamps at this point so I had to get back on the road despite the PTSD... in fact, the next time I got a Bob as a customer for my ""next ride"", I promptly pulled over, almost threw up, and declined the ride.

I eventually called the DA's (District Attorney)'s office to see what's going on and what's taking them so long to let me press charges. I found out my case was dropped. Dropped?! I was told that there's no evidence...

I was outraged. I had all the evidence in the world. I had my Uber app which documents the ride took place. I have his address. I have his name. I have the time stamp of when the ride started, when the ride ended, and I also have the timestamp for the police report, not to mention they took photos of my neck injury.

And I called the person in charge of my case... some guy named Minoui... He told me he dropped the case because Bob had a witness and it was his friend who testified that nothing happened. That this case was just a he said she said at this point. I told him about the pile of evidence I had on my side and how I didn't even get asked by the DA my side of the story or whether I had evidence and that I have a PHOTO of my injuries. He said ""oh"" like he didn't realize that, then said that the case is closed, that he has years of experience (Tone of voice was condescending like he was talking to a kid) and that even if we put this in front of a judge we can't get a conviction because the jury has to vote unanimously. I told him I wanted it in a court of law anyway and that he didn't have the right to be judge and jury for my case, and then he told me rudely that he did as a DA and hung up on me. I tried to ""speak to a manager"" by calling his higher up, and his higher up just backed him up... told me I had no case, that the guy had no priors so he's ""unimpeachable"", I told him "" so I can just go out and murder someone and you don't even put my case in a court because I have no priors so I'm UNIMPEACHABLE?"" He said there's not enough evidence of injury, that I didn't have a doctor's diagnosis, nor do I have video evidence. I didn't bring up that the guy was WHITE and I'm a minority (Asian) but essentially that's what it felt was going on at that point in the conversation, and I just hung up on this prick, I then called the County Superintendent/Supervisers... Super something ... Board of Trustteess? Fuck I don't know, important douchebags paid to look important who signs off on paperwork that affects the lives of many. Some librarian told me that's who is in charge of the DA schmucks. SO I called them and THEY told me that it was perfectly in the right of the DA to decide what gets put in front of a judge and what doesn't get put in front of a judge and please stop swearing. I told them they can go... well you know what I told them (excuse my Americanism).

It was at this point I also called Uber Support for further evidence. Some Indian guy with a heavy accent replied on the phone and said ""I'm bery bery sori sir, but I cunt dew anyting about dis, but I understand your frustratin' and I cunt halp yew with dis. We cannot give out information about our passengers"". I was just asking for information to use as proof to reopen my case mind you, but they just wouldn't budge on the phone with me, so THAT's how much Uber cares for the safety of their drivers... ZILCH... NADA, UBER DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEM THEIR MONEY.

Lesson 4: I put a camera in my car now on my dash and I point it directly at me for my own protection whenever I drive now... that's the only way you can prove some white drunk asshole strangled you in your car apparently. If you're a minority and you drive ride share, I suggest you do the same. If you're white, you don't worry about a thing, the law's got your back.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/f4vmd4/my_experiences_as_an_uber_driver_fair_car_rental/

Must be nice.

I got a warning to be deactivated without having any flagged rides and was not given any feedback.

I also have a 5.0 rating and haven't driven for Lyft in a month.

Yeah, this is bullshit, race has nothing to do with it. 

Reality is, Bob has a friend to back him up to say nothing happened, you have nothing but your own word. 2 people saying nothing happened, 1 person saying something happened, you're outnumbered. You were screwed the minute you let them out of the car and continued on to take your next ride. It sucks, but it's reality. Race has nothing to do with it.

Ironic you cry about racism and adopt a victim mentality, but make fun of Indians.

So back to Lyft... This time I had more... customer satisfaction experience... and I wasn't an ""entry level worker"" anymore... I was a ""manager""... I saw my Lyft driving experience as a small business that I'm running for myself as an independent contractor, and I worked smart.

It also helped that Lyft actually had training videos regarding their customer service expectations, AND those videos also addressed many of the issues I experienced as a driver regarding driver safety and Lyft actually CARES enough about the safety of their drivers to give an opportunity for us drivers to give feedback on customer behavior and complaints!

Here's what happened last week...

I got a complaint from someone for ""using my phone"" while driving Lyft. Lyft actually sent me an email asking for my side of the story and asked me to explain the circumstances! HOLY COW! I wrote back and explained that often times people I take in my car wants to hear or listen to different music or that they want to charge their phones, so I either unplug my phone to let them plug in to the car for music or battery charging OR I ask them to look up their favorite artists on my Spotify Premium account so we can all listen to their favorite artists together... Thats my customer service that I provide...

I've also been working on my ratings by strictly working only in the mornings from around 4 AM to around 11 AM. This is EASY because people are so relaxed and happy in the morning! AND they are usually quiet and not talkative so I can just play music and have a relaxing time at work, and they often tip me since I lead the ride with questions like ""Did you want the windows down or up?"" or ""Are you late for work? Is our current ETA of 14 minutes ok with you?"" And that made a huge difference... my ratings are now 4.99 for the last 100 rides!

Two nights ago, I got a random report stating that I was in a car accident from Lyft because someone is claiming that I was in an accident... so Lyft disabled my app and told me to send pictures of the ""damage"" and that the claims team will review the damage and see if I am covered by their deductibles of up to $25000 worth of vehicle damage... funny thing is? I wasn't in an accident.

I was quite upset last night due to not being able to drive and I can't send pictures because it's night and there's no light to take pictures of my car... but this morning... I took pictures, sent them in on the app through the link they sent me on my phone via text, then replied the the EMAIL they ALSO sent me regarding the report that I was in an accident...

Before I was even able to finish typing my email, my account was notified that it was back online and I could drive again. It was that quick! Within 5 minutes of me sending the pictures! Can you imagine? Compare that with Fair's customer support line... that's night and day.

Lesson 6: If you want to work as a driver for ride share, work for Lyft. They actually care about their drivers just as much as they care about their customers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/f4vmd4/my_experiences_as_an_uber_driver_fair_car_rental/fhu2uvu/

Story 5: My experience as a Lyft Driver

I'm a full time Lyft Driver now... I'm still telling people I'm an actor and I got an agent and occasionally I go on auditions for commercials (Still no theatrical auditions yet this year... and it's Pilot Season until March... I'm pretty pissed with my agent right now honestly... I'm actually about to switch agents... I don't care how famous or successful she is, because she's not sending me out at ALL for theatrical and that's just going to make me a Lyft Driver... nobody signs up with Lyft or Uber expecting that to be their career for life by that's how life works sometimes). In any case...

The point of all of this is ironically to give praise to Lyft.

I'm not saying I haven't had problems as a Lyft driver, no... I've had plenty of PROBLEMS, but it is the way that Lyft as a company handles these issues with me that made me make the time to write all these stories out here on Reddit to showcase what a difference Lyft is and how grateful I am to be driving for them as a Lyft Driver.

Initially the switch over to Lyft was a bitter one due to being banned from Uber. I was really having a rough time. On top of that I had to avoid driving for a living all together and got a job at a local Papa Johns and made pizzas from scratch by hand for a while, simply because the driving was getting so stressful for me that I had a negative attitude and that was easily seen by my passengers and I was getting negative reviews left and right from passengers and I saw where this was headed and when I got my first report of ""reckless driving"" unfairly from a passenger because I swerved out of a way of an aggressive driver who tried to cut me off with his shiny new Maserati, I knew I had to work something else other than driving for a bit just to clear my head space about all this. I did get a warning from Lyft that if I get another similar report within the ""next 30 days"" that my account might be suspended. I didn't want to risk that further and was glad I got the job at Papa Johns...

In fact I was so glad to work something else for a change that I helped the Papa Johns I worked at turn from being the least profitable, losing money instead of making money, likely going to get closed down location, to being the highest earning, super busy with customers all the time, and amazing customer loyalty and reviews Store/location in that area of LA. I was also promoted to Assistant Manager and might have soon trained to be a GM but sadly things got weird there and I had to leave due to the owners having different ideas about how they wanted to run things and having a different perception of me...

I'll say this very briefly since my work at Papa Johns is not directly related to rideshare, but it did help me see from a business perspective.

Initially there was a manager there who literally made pizzas for herself to eat and also for us other coworkers... I was appreciative of course, but then this happened every day, and I kept it hush hush because hey, I'm a starving artist, I needed the food ok? Living on foodstamps and eating one meal a day isn't easy. BUT then I noticed this manager wasn't working during the times it was busy... she didn't answer any phones, she told us workers without the management position to go answer phones, work the pizza oven, roll out the pizza dough, stock the walk in freezer, etc. That's all fine and within her rights, but SHE wasn't doing... ANYTHING. SHE was watching Netflix on her phone, talking to her friends on the phone... talking to other coworkers and having long conversations while there's a long line of hungry and angry people waiting for over an hour for their pizzas, and when I'm the only one there with her I'm doing 100% of the work of trying to satisfy a long line of hungry people, while answering the phone, AND making the pizzas... I got pissed and told the boss/owner about this. She got fired. Then I got to work with another manager who was high all the time... and a long story short, the bosses wanted to fire him for being on weed all the time, but I told them that would be a terrible mistake because this guy was FAST. He could make pizza quickly and when it came down to a busy dinner rush, I'd much rather have him working with me than any of the other managers. This made the Owners look at me differently and offered to train me as management. I was very happy about this, and soon I was also a manager and I became friends with this guy who was high all the time, and eventually got to know his problems and helped him resolve some of the issues. I was also someone he could talk to during work WHILE we also kept busy and made sure all the pizza orders were made in a timely manner, and this made him look forward to coming to work each day and it made him go sober eventually at work. Things were looking up, but then the owners wanted ""More and better"" and took to getting down the the details of looking at how fast I made my pizzas... which ... I timed it... takes me about 11 minutes and 7 seconds or so to make a pizza from just dough to serving it in a box after cutting it. That's too slow to them apparently... my ""style"" of work is to make things perfect... my pizzas always came out looking better than the pizzas they showed on the commercials... The owners didn't care about that... they didn't care that I had the highest tip rate out of all the managers due to me remembering to talk to the customers briefly to ask how's their day, eventually gaining some regulars, and it didn't matter that I eventually got customers looking for me by name because I knew their ""usual"" and knew what they wanted before they needed to order it. No, all they wanted me to do was make pizzas FASTER and use ""less ingredients"" to cut costs... I made the best ""standard"" pizzas that were in my own opinion perfection... literally the pizzas had perfect crusts with a lip all the way around, the slices were evenly cut, and the cheese and toppings evenly spread out and the right amount... but no... that's too slow. That's not as fast as my friend who is now sober and works faster than me... I had to ""beat him"" to be able to be a GM... and because I wasn't fast for the sake of fast and refused to sacrifice quality... and despite the fact that I believe I was the key factor for turning that whole store around from being unprofitable to being the MOST profitable location that they owned (the owners even told me), they started giving me less hours, hired more new people who didn't know what they were doing but gave them more hours and me less hours so they could train them... and well... I saw where things were headed, and I quit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/f4vmd4/my_experiences_as_an_uber_driver_fair_car_rental/fhu2tuf/

Another report for ""speeding"" came from the most RIDICULOUS person...

Some kid... maybe 18 or 19 years old... got into my car. He told me his license was suspended and that he was getting a ride because he couldn't drive for a month as a result of speeding. I'm like ""cool story bro"" and kept driving. HE looks at my speedometer and was staring intently at it... NO JOKE... And then when I was going 45 mph on a 40 speed limit street, he just starts flipping out and screaming at me about me SPEEDING and ENDANGERING HIS PASSENGER and being HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL, and that he was going to give me a 1 star review for SPEEDING. I had enough of this so I pulled over and told him to get the fuck out of my car. He didn't, and instead shoved his phone in my face to show me his review. I pulled out my phone and gave him a 1 star review too... but sadly UBER doesn't give a fuck about passenger behavior since I can't even write a comment about what happened... instead my account got a ""final warning"" if something else happened to my account the next time... my account would be permanently banned.

I drove Lyft and Uber at the same time after that to try to avoid driving Uber for a while. Uber actually pays a little tiny bit better over all because Uber's payment formula pays more for your time spent on trip than Lyft does while Lyft's formula pays you more for your mileage spent on the trip and typically in LA at the very least, driving in LA is SLOW so time is more valuable... so I try to drive Uber more than Lyft ... and to be even smarter about my earnings I turned both apps on... so that I didn't have to wait too long before a ride would show up on one of my apps, and I'd accept it and turn off the other app to drive to pick up the passenger. Sometimes this results in two requests at the exact same time and I have to cancel one of the rides... I prioritized longer rides, and I prioritized Uber... for the reasons I mentioned already. Well... this also hurts the ""acceptance rate"" statistic in the app, and since I was already low on my ratings... about 4.87 on my Uber App (and yes anything below a 4.9 rating in Uber is considered low ratings... and it's almost like I'm working on a GPA or Report card once more... haha)... this meant that low acceptance rate, low ratings and several reports really endangered my standings with Uber...

The final straw was just hilarious but at this point I'm so goth I can laugh at death itself. So bring on the funnies! The last straw that got me banned was a girl in her 20's. I had decided at this time to protect my ratings by only driving in the mornings to bring people to work, and they tended to be happier, friendlier, and less lightly to give a bad review... maybe because they just had their coffee and was going to work fresh from a night's rest.

BUT this was too little too late and I had no more buffer for another mistake with Uber... so when I dropped her off, and gave her a verbal compliment about how cute she looked with her cool hairstyle (she had really cool hair ok? and honestly I wasn't hitting on her... if anything I was fishing for a tip)...

She reported me for making comments about her looks and ""leering at her""... oh boi...

I got banned from Uber. That was the final straw, they said it was a final decision. They didn't care that all these reports against me were given totally unfairly. Uber did not give me a chance to explain the circumstances of these reports. I was just permanently banned, PERIOD, end of discussion.

Lesson 5: I learned that if you're driving ride share, customer perception matters A LOT. You have to win over your customer immediately from the get go... immediately saying ""Hows your day?"" or ""Would you like the windows down? Or do you prefer the AC?"" ""Hey let me know if you're running late, our ETA is about 20 minutes due to heavy traffic, is that ok?"" Is how you DEFEND and PROTECT your Ratings on your App. Because at least in Uber's case they don't give a shit about what your perspective is, you have to protect yourself from passenger bad reviews by making sure you give a good first impression right off the bat. It is a good policy as well to air out your car after a ride with a drunk passenger or anyone who smelled bad. In addition, if there's a need to swerve to avoid a car accident, I've learned now from experience to IMMEDIATELY talk to the customer about the situation in a laughing and calming voice to help put them at ease, while NOT ADMITTING FAULT, and pointing out the mistake of the other driver and what you did to safely avoid an accident. Usually the customer would laugh with you, shake their heads or make a comment about crazy LA traffic and crazy drivers OUT THERE as opposed to the driver driving them to their destination. REGARDLESS of whether it is your fault or not, protect your reviews and ratings by LAUGHING IT OFF WITH THE PASSENGER! It helps a ton! I've even gotten tips nowadays for GOOD DRIVING, after avoiding an accident as a Lyft Driver. Also, know that driving at certain times of the day/night comes with certain risks. Driving late at night on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night and you'll get plenty of money and plenty of frequent ride requests on the apps, but you'll also get lots of drunk people and also frequently people who are upset from a long week at work and are ready and willing to take it out on their Uber driver! Don't let them! IMMEDIATELY OFFER GOOD SERVICE TO PROTECT YOUR REPUTATION FROM UPSET ANGRY PEOPLE!",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/f4vmd4/my_experiences_as_an_uber_driver_fair_car_rental/fhu2t1o/

Story 4: How I got banned/fired from Uber and started working for Lyft.

So around the time after I couldn't work for Uber due to car registration issues, I realized the biggest threat to my financial stability is being unable to work. SO I signed up for Lyft as a back up plan due to what happened and this story is going to get really stupid really fast..

So one night, I was driving late at night, the usual drunk people... I got over my PTSD ... albeit slowly, and I actually had PTSD from other things in the past so this wasn't my first trip to mental health recovery, so I knew the tools such as rapid eye movement and such things as relaxation and breathing techniques... I self therapized until I was better. But I digress... One thing, I was driving drunk people late at night as usual... and here's what happened.

I dropped off a girl who was so drunk that you can smell not only alcohol but also weed and possibly other drugs on her breath. She was a teen, but I didn't ask questions, she was coming home from some ""party"" at some adults house... yeah that's messed up I know, but let's say as an Uber driver we see more messed up shit than some cops do. I just wanted to make sure she got home safe as her ride home and after I dropped her off I went off to my next ride.

My next ride was a woman and her best friend coming home from a party... kinda your yuppie white group of people... in a nice well to do neighborhood. She and her friend chatted with me during the drive and she told me she had a baby at home. I told her that's awesome, congrats on being a mom! And then she asked what I did besides Uber and I told her that I am an actor with an agent who's ""famous"" but doesn't submit me enough to get auditions for the past year and how I'm thinking of dropping her for a different agent. Then... she and her friend asked me if I knew there was a turn coming up, I'm like ""yup there's a turn coming up and I see in on my GPS""... in my mind I'm like ""don't be a backseat driver, seriously..."" then she got more and interested in my driving and asked if I've driven down this road before... I told her I drove everywhere as an Uber driver, that my passengers typically determined where I was going to go and it's not up to me. She kept asking me weird questions like ""did you know there's a lot of cops on this road at this time of night?"" I'm like uh, really? Ok that's nice to know, good to know they're actually out doing something for the community...

Near their destination, they suddenly told me to stop and pull over, I did, and they got out of the car and let out a big ""WHEW!"" like they made it! Freedom! I shook my head and drove off...

5 minutes later I was blocked from using the Uber App. I was reported for Drunk Driving. I laughed.

So that's what they were going on and on about? Didn't they realize that my entire job was to pick up drunk people and drop them off at their home safely since they're too drunk to drive?!

I called Uber Support, they did the whole Indian accent thing with ""I'm bery bery sori sir, I understand your frustration, but I can't do anyting about dis right now, we have to wait for the support team to review your case, sir"".

So I was... late on rent... Jewish roommate who made very rude comments about my work ethics and all that (she has no sympathy for PTSD apparently). I didn't look forward to going home early that night not being able to work and pay off my rent after repeatedly promising that I would.

So I went to the house that I picked her up at... not where I drop her off... I mean I didn't want to go after a woman who was afraid I'm drunk in the middle of the night at her house... that'll look bad to the cops if she decided to call them. I decided to go talk to her husband who I knew from conversation was still at the party.

I knocked on the door and talked with her husband about what his wife just did, which was unfairly reporting me as a drunk driver, and I told him to smell my breath... no alcohol... just drunk passengers all night. He asked me what I wanted. I asked for 200 dollars. That's what I would have made if I drove for 12 hours straight on that Friday night all night. He said he was about to ship off to his assignment in the military and that he didn't have any money. Some of his friends came out and tried to start an argument or cause drama and when they eventually realized I wasn't there for that papa mama drama bullshit they see on TV on shows like Jerry Springer, and that I just wanted what's fair, and that I was calm and collected and very very severely depressed and had NO ENERGY to fight over anything, they backed off and instead talked about how the woman I'm accusing of reporting me for drunk driving was a really good person and that she'd never hurt a fly... great, I just wanted my money so I can pay my rent. Upon realizing we were at an impasse, I offered to the husband instead to settle the matter in a different way... that he call his wife and tell her to go on the Uber App and rescind her report or contact support and let them know that she might not be correct and that she didn't smell alcohol on my BREATH but in my CAR and that is a very important distinction to make.

He told me he would... I could tell he understood the seriousness of the matter, and his night was kind of ruined by this whole thing, but at the same time he was likely going to be responsible and do the right thing... and not to mention they were likely going to have a shouting argument that night between him and his wife... all that I could tell while I stood there, but I was too exhausted to feel any sympathy at that point and just wanted this matter to be settled so I can get back on the road.

Uber took like two whole days... two DAYS for them to finally reactivate my account.

I had to ask my mother yet again to help me with rent due to the delay and this is when I signed up with Lyft as a back up plan in case this happened again with Uber.

In the next month, I also got a report for ""reckless driving"" from another customer...

The situation was, some asshole on the road cut me off to get on the highway ramp. I honked my horn and that triggered the guy to get road rage on me... Mad Max Fury Road style and just kept driving in front of me and slamming the breaks, then when I tried to swerve around him to get around he'd put on his high beams (this was at night so the high beams would make it really hard to drive with the rear view mirror and my side mirrors flooding my vision with too much light) and since this was the highway this was very dangerous... I slowed to a crawl and he got in front of me to slam on the breaks again and again, so after 2 repeats of this I just floored it... I put pedal to the metal to get away from the road rage driver as soon as humanly possible. I was going about 90 and weaved through several cars ahead of me to get away from this dangerous person. AND I got... a ""reckless driving"" report from my customer... I mean, I feel like I just can't please anyone ... I drove away to get to safety. I avoided a dangerous situation. I avoided potentially a car accident waiting to happen... but instead of a thank you, I got a 1 star report... my ratings tanked...",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/f4vmd4/my_experiences_as_an_uber_driver_fair_car_rental/fhu2ry5/
26,f9qf0i,CattiPrint,Some tips that I hope helps and a rant,uberdrivers,0.0,1,"Hopefully I can help someone with this post. I've been up because I've been having bad delivery experiences to the point where now I'm kinda afraid to order from the apps I drive for. I drive for uber eats,  DD, instacart, and Bite Squad.

When I started delivering in Dec. It surprised me from the reactions I use to get from customers. Like I was a gift from heaven and some have asked for me to be their personal.  I never understood this until I started ordering from the apps. My DD drivers are terrible. Missing items and cold food.  On top of that they don't follow directions. I though uber drivers would do better because I've done ride sharing and my drivers were always wonderful. Wrong! I'm sure there are good drivers,  but the bad is severely out weighing the good. 

I just ordered an hour ago and I'm still trying to figure out what to do. I always give instructions to my house and that you should call and never knock! I have dogs,  kids,  grandparents and I don't want anyone woken up. This guy read none of my instructions and not only did he go to the wrong door,  HE KNOCKED! Woke everyone,  I felt bad. I texted him that he was at the wrong door (that door doesn't open). He didn't read that either. I went to our other door (the one every one had ever used, even other deliveries). He wasn't there. He had went to his car THEN called me. 

""Are you gonna come get your food?"" He had an attitude.

I snapped. I was pissed. You disregarded my instructions,  woke everyone in my house,  AND you give me attitude!

I told him that I texted him he was at the wrong door.  He then acted like my house didn't have another door. I baby stepped this man on how to walk around my house and come to my other door. I even had to describe my driveway and my street isn't dark!

Then he spilled my drink and my food was cold.

Had he followed instructions he would have gotten a good review and a tip. This wouldn't have happened. I haven't touch the rate and tip button, because I'm still mad. He get rated,  but no tip. I hate leaving one star reviews even if they deserve it. Unfortunately,  he's not the only one I've encountered and they're growing.

Look I don't know your life and what happens to you. If you're upset, don't take it out on someone you don't know. I've ended up delivering for certain customers twice and it's suprising.

I'm Gainesville, Florida and on slow days I make $13/hr and on normal days, $16 /hr, and $20/hr on good days. Gainesville isn't a big city.

1. Invest in insulated bags with zippers. Customers love this because to them it means you care. My back seat is full! I bought 2 XL for $14 on Amazon, Bite Squad gave me a huge XXL that takes up half my back seat and a pizza bag. DD gave me a small red one. I also bought small publix bags for my grocery deliveries. I have no excuse to deliver my customer cold hot food and warm cold food. You will get the investment back. Hot/ cold packs are an extra bonus!

2. Always match the receipt to your app. Make sure you have everything. Do not walk away until you're sure. Restaurants can forget, but it's your job to remember. The customer will hold you accountable.

3. Follow instructions. Always check to see if your customers left instructions. If they did not, don't be afraid to contact them.  If you can't reach them,  always ALWAYS contact support,  but make sure you have done this next step.

4. Document everything! Im not just talking about your money. I'm talking about the order. Take tons of pictures, text the customer before ever calling unless specified. This is for those ""leave at the door "" or if your lost, or you've been waiting. Cover your butt, plus customer love it to. It shows you did your job and that you care. Before I leave a house and the customer asked me to leave it at the door,  they're getting 5+ pictures, plus the mandatory pictures. I'm going to make sure you know you got everything. Support will help if they got the proof.

5. Night deliveries should invest in a flash light. I bought mine from the dollar store. I have chronic depression and anxiety,  getting lost on a dark road is not favorable where my only light was my car. But people also don't like seeing cars creep.

6. Don't be a jerk. I've had some bad deliveries that made me want to pull teeth and hair. You know the only difference between my good deliveries and a bad one? My face. I have a blank straight face. They still get the same level of service as my best orders.

7. Always confirm who your customer is. There are a lot of complaints about people delivering to the wrong people. Your app will always have your customers name. Confirm that is them. If it's not them ask a small question that made it seem like you are trying to make sure you have everything.  ""Do you remember what they ordered? I want to make sure I have everything for you"" or ""Are you....I don't know how to say your name."" They'll always answer correctly if it's the right person. If it's a spouse, they'll majority of the time comment on how they're spouse ordered and sometimes chuckle. I had a guy who didn't expect me at all, his daughter didn't mention an order (my customer). I knew from his comments I was at the right place.
This one also helps for customers who rush and try to grab your food. They could be the wrong person.  Not everyone pays attention to who the driver is. I usually just back up and ask even if I'm at the door. I could be at the wrong house.

8. Never be afraid to ask for help. 

I've written a lot. Hopefully this helps.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/f9qf0i/some_tips_that_i_hope_helps_and_a_rant/

Maybe next week I will try to do food delivery half time even though it doesn't pay as much, just to try to stay sane through the week.

Ratings don't really matter.  The more 5* trips you complete, the less those below 5* will impact your total.  Over time/trips the low rates will go away.  Unless you're in an oversaturated market (too many drivers), Uber isn't likely to deactivate you for a low rating.  It usually takes 2 or more complaints for the same thing.  By complaints I don't mean the canned feedback you might get when are low rated.  I mean an actual complaint made by the rider.

I get that depending on where you work, Uber driving can be great or absolutely terrible, and that some of the people who work in the latter get mad when those in the former complain. But besides that there's a lot of pettiness and obnoxious attitudes here. It's baffling.

Like some of you are just camping here waiting to pounce on other drivers - usually new ones - for making unwise decisions. It doesn't make sense. Like do you guys know how many drivers there are? Do you think putting down one driver as if you're crushing competition will have any impact on your own work?

How does this hostility benefit you? Wouldn't you rather a sub where drivers uplift each other and give each other advice? We're not your enemies lol.

It's sad because I picture these drivers on their break at McDonald's or wherever just spending their free time lurking on reddit and making others feel worse, and I just feel so bad for them.

274,h17ex8d,NotRoryWilliams,,uberdrivers,,4,,"I’m starting to kind of doubt my own negative attitude, to be honest.  Yes, there’s a lot to be frustrated about. The other day I had destination mode on, but still got pulled half an hour out of my way to take a $6 ride of all of two miles. I broke my own rules on this ride, too - took more passengers than I should have including an unsecured child, a cardinal sin I always rail against, but I felt bad for the family who were clearly foreigners traveling and didn’t deserve to suffer for not knowing the local laws. But still, they didn’t even tip… but I didn’t really want to turn wasting my time and effort for $6 into wasting my time and effort for $0. 

But on the whole, I’ve actually done pretty decently with rideshare lately. For one thing, I’m actually turning a paper profit, as annoying as that is (because I will actually have to pay taxes); my accountant had told me he never sees that, but because I only drive comfort and xl and only drive peak hours, I stay busy enough to turn a profit even after deducting 58 cents for every unpaid mile. I’m actually usually averaging around $30-35 per hour, and spending a small fraction of that on gas. 

In fact, I’ve got a pretty strong objective measure of profitability: the account balance. I stopped having rideshare deposits link to my main checking account and instead got a separate account and debit card just for rideshare. Out of this account come all of my car-related expenditures except my car payment itself, which I consider a debt payment so it comes out of my debt payment account; but I may one day move it to the rideshare account. Anyway, the account has done okay - in the last couple months I’ve shifted to paying all my car maintenance, insurance, gas, and most of my fast food and some of my groceries, basically all of my travel and leisure spending, out of that account. Now my day job income goes 100% to bills and budgeted spending, and all of my “fun money” including travel is covered by my habit of working an average of five to seven hours a week driving. 

My heart does go out to full-time drivers who don’t have a day job to rely on; I doubt that I’d be able to sustain $35 an hour if I was doing it 40+ hours a week. But maybe. Some of the goal bonuses start to get significant once you are doing 80+ rides per week. I normally take the 20 ride bonus and don’t even hit it most weeks. But I really should - if I can save up by driving hard for a month or so, I should be able to take a nice long road trip in August when my calendar slows down a bit due to people I work with tending to vacation around that time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/nvrj6k/why_are_so_many_drivers_here_assholes_to_each/h17ex8d/

284,h16o37y,sonofsochi,,uberdrivers,,1,,"I get that and it kinda plays in to what i was saying about drivers not understanding the financial aspect too well. I dont do X anymore since it doesnt provide enough of an incentive to deviate from Black but when I did drive X, i never put in more than 30 hours and On the weekends I shut it off before Midnight to avoid the drunkies. I made a decent net return but I think you are correct in the sense that alot of people just dont know how to properly get into it in the first place. 

Ironically now there are different ways to make money off of uberr with eats and packages, etc. but people buy these 2019 Accords and are upset that they cant outpace the depreciation on the car alone, let alone its maintenance and components.

285,h16mrn3,blackngoldheart,,uberdrivers,,4,,"That’s understandable for you to think that.  I offer you another perspective from my own personal experience of over 6.5 years, full time the last 3.5, having driven in multiple markets and speaking to friends who are drivers in multiple other markets. I 100% support my ENTIRE life on X very comfortably.  Part time hours: In less than 30 hours a week I bring in anywhere from $1200-$1500.   

I recognize that the pay structure has evolved over the years, seemingly to the detriment of the driver, but it just requires more strategy to be successful now.  That 80-20 split in the beginning was never going to be sustainable.  It’s not as easy to just hop in your car and accept every ride to make money, you have to be very strategic in when and where you drive and which trips you accept and decline. 

Also, If by “most markets” you mean “the state of California” I agree with you.   There is a whole other world of issues going on out there.  The covid lockdowns also changed behavior patterns and how, when and where people move around the country.  I think many people are struggling to understand that part and how to pivot to make X still work for them.  

I believe overall, most Americans don’t understand how to properly manage their finances, so the bigger issue is not “making enough money” but how to efficient deploy the money that is made.  Also how to manage a small business is key to being successful in Uber: because that is exactly what each driver is, a small business owner.  Many drivers that I see add to this sub, sound like angry employees rather than determined business owners.

352,ogllfs,R_G_Reventlov,Strangely enough I posted on here a few months ago asking about going to ASU through Uber and asking how I was going to be screwed. I was given some positive feedback and decided that it really did seem like a good deal. Completed my rides and deactivated. I did not expect to be screwed this way.,uberdrivers,8.0,1,"Honestly, this is most likely just some weird error due to too much automation or maybe I'm in the wrong? During covid last year I sold my jeep.  I use a Honda insight for work and the jeep had hit the typical jeep mark where it just needs too much money.  Well, when I sold my car I didn't return the plates, brain fart. Oh well I'll look up what to do.  Was difficult to understand,  seemed as though the dmv was closed and in order to fix this I needed to submit the bill of sale. So I sent it in with my registration and such.  Didn't think anything of it.  Never received any mail, wonder why lol florida.  About a month ago I get a message from uber to update my car insurance. I'm like ok it got renewed 5 months ago,  and everything is good with it? So I send a pic,  literally a new one from the geico website. All good. A week later my account is suspended for suspended license due to lack of insurance. I'm given a background check by Checkr that confirms this.  I'm dumbfounded. I call my insurance.  They assure me that my insurance is fine and they didn't do anything to me, I trust them because I'm pretty pissed I'm 15 miles away from my house driving illegally.  I get home and start looking into things through the dmv and it's for the jeep.  Ok that's dumb.  Thanks florida. Go to the dmv the next day.  Wait 3 hours. Present bill of sale and pay $6 and my license is good. Send in paperwork of clearance to checkr.  Wait. Denied. Try to talk to uber, they say talk to checkr.  Try to appeal. Get told I'll get a call.  Never get a call.  Deactivated. Get the same background check sent to me. They didn't do a new one or check anything.  I'm pretty depressed at this point. Try to keep appealing to checkr. No reply ever to anything.  Try calling uber and I only get an automated message to call checkr and no other options. So I'm like, I'm resilient.  I can figure something out.  So I apply to doordash. Doesn't work with my original info so I use different email.  Literally all I had to change.  Accepted to doordash and I got a clean background from guess who, Checkr. Sent both these background checks back to checkr. Never hear anything. So I guess i can do doordash now.

I don't call it venting, necessarily. I understand it a bit differently.

To me, it's our genius trying to get the f*k out! 

We, as humans with this crazy contraption we call a brain need to talk things out in order to figure them out. Like all genius's known for talking to them selves, it is in how our brain operates that makes us talk things out with a complete stranger. Our complex lives, all of the nuances and disconnected minutia of life sort just floats around in the back of our minds, unable to coalesce on its own. It is when we express all if these thoughts and such that it comes through the frontal lobe, where our filters, sense of reason and decision making is done. Once all of what seems like gibberish at first is expressed in some way, be it via speaking, writing, art, math, what ever form it takes to convey it all through that frontal lobe so that it can donuts job. Spew it all out through it and the filter and reason kicks in, distilling and putting the remainder together like puzzle pieces.

So, enough of that. To put much more simply, you are providing a greater service than a ride and an ear. The ear your give gives an unbiased place for people to really figure things out, great or small the issue might be. A safe space for people, sometimes, to get a hold of something that was spiraling out of control.

What you do is so much more important than you might think!

And I thank you for that🤙😊👍

428,qdn4p8,sentimental_heathen,How difficult/easy is it for a driver to take home $400/week just by driving for Uber?,uberdrivers,100.0,1,"Hi all,

I'm currently in between jobs, and I'm also struggling with a little bit of depression, so I desperately want to get out of the house and do something. My problem with normal 9-5 jobs has been with how repetitive and meaningless they are, and my inability to grind it out, and stick around long enough to where the work becomes tolerable.  So I want to switch things up and try something I've never done before: be an Uber driver.  

Because I have so few bills to pay, my monthly expenses are fairly low, so all I need is approx $400/week to survive. How many hours would I have to dedicate each week to driving in order to make that kind of money? Would I be better off just find a $15/hr pitstop job I can tolerate until I figure out what I want to do with my life?

505,hhnxnm1,NotRoryWilliams,,uberdrivers,,3,,"It’s going to vary by a couple of factors, mainly the local market conditions (where you are). If you are in the middle of nowhere, your earnings prospects probably won’t be great, but if you live near an airport, college, busy commercial area, or restaurant/bar district, your prospects will improve. 

The next factor is the kind of rides you can give, which depends on your car. Uber X is the lowest-paying kind of ride, but the only kind that a lot of cars qualify. Some luxury and premium cars qualify for Uber Comfort, which is a slightly higher pay rate, but there are also additional conditions to driving Comfort. Uber XL is the highest paying type of ride in most markets, and it requires a seven-passenger vehicle such as a minivan or three-row SUV. Finally, there is also Uber Black, which pays the highest of all, but it has to be a luxury car in the color black, and there are additional requirements as well, and it’s not even offered in all markets. There’s also Uber Pet, in some markets, which is a little higher than Uber X if you want to let people bring their dogs along, but that’s more risk to you and more cleaning. 

The next big variable is when you drive. Demand for rides is incredibly variable between hours and days. In commercial districts, it’ll be busier during commuting hours. In bar districts, it’ll be busiest on weekend nights. In college areas, it can be pretty variable but will tend to cluster closely with bar hours and parties. You will *generally* make more money working nights and weekends than during 9-5 hours. If you don’t want to work nights, you should plan to work early mornings and late afternoons to catch commuters. The block of time that is consistently the lowest earning, in most markets, is literally 9-5 business days. This is a pretty awful job option if you want to work 9-5 hours. 

So, what do I get? I drive a luxury SUV and I only accept XL rides. I almost exclusively work weekend nights. I usually start driving around 8pm Friday and go until an hour after the bars close, which used to be 5 am but now it’s usually 4. I do the same hours on Saturday night, and often Thursdays as well, depending on my day job obligations on Friday. I really only drive Sundays when there’s a football game; otherwise Sundays are usually very slow and I’ll only sign on if I’m trying to hit a number of rides for a weekend bonus. Sometimes I sign in on weeknights when I’m bored or really hard up for cash, but weeknights are often awful. 

I have sometimes averaged upwards of $50 an hour on a Friday or Saturday night, but I’ve had a few bad Fridays recently that barely broke $100 for the whole night. On weeknights, I basically just sit on my couch watching Star Trek while waiting for pings; I don’t even think about “dollars per hour” on those nights since most of it is waiting, not working; but since I can do other things while waiting it’s not so bad. 

In general, I tend to earn between $25-35 per hour driving, before deducting expenses. My only expenses are fuel and maintenance, since my vehicle is already fully depreciated and the insurance actually cost me less than it did before rideshare. Fuel and maintenance cost less than 10% of what I earn, on average, because my rate per mile is consistently well above a dollar a mile. Typically a $60 tank of gas will get me through a full weekend of driving with plenty to spare. 

XL can earn up to 50% more per mile and minute than X, so if you don’t have an XL vehicle expect to earn at least a third less than me, and probably than anyone bragging about how much they make per hour since most dedicated drivers buy minivans for it. 

Anyway, unless you’re in a really slow market, $400 a week shouldn’t be hard to achieve at all, even after deducting your expenses. The IRS mileage deduction of 57.5 cents a mile is usually way more than what a mile of driving actually costs; it’s calculated based on the cost to own or lease a recently purchased vehicle and basically assumes around 15 cents a mile for fuel, a quarter a mile for depreciation, a dime a mile for maintenance, and the rest for insurance. If you drive an older car that’s already done most of its depreciating, then you can almost ignore depreciation, but fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs will always be there. 

Oh, speaking of insurance, you *must* get rideshare insurance. Your existing company may be able to add a rider to your policy, but most carriers don’t offer this coverage in most markets, so you will probably need to look up who offers rideshare insurance in your state and switch to that company. My rate actually went down when I switched, but I went from a premium insurer (USAA) to an average one, Allstate. I’d be happy to explain more on why you need rideshare coverage, but basically your regular insurance may not cover you *at all* if you have an accident while driving rideshare, and the rideshare company’s insurance will only cover you for part of the time you are driving and has extremely high deductibles for damage to your car. Adequate insurance can mean the difference between an accident bringing total and permanent financial ruin, or just being a minor inconvenience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/qdn4p8/how_difficulteasy_is_it_for_a_driver_to_take_home/hhnxnm1/

It might be a good fit for you because it isn't boring and the time flies. On average you might be able to do 2 rides/ hr maybe 3 if it is all short rides and very busy.

I would say it isn't always a set amount and you can achieve $400/week it would take on average maybe about 25-30 hrs if you drive during slow times and if you drive on friday or saturday nights maybe even in less than 15.


The key to earnings is knowing your market. With experience driving around and knowing where the hotspots are you might even be able to make $400 in 10 hours all depending on if your market is busy enough to allow it.

536,qylo1w,jayroo210,Uber driving as an introvert with anxiety,uberdrivers,34.0,1,"Hey guys, I was just looking for some advice or experiences. I’m an introvert who deals with depression/anxiety. I work full time and just started driving for Uber for part time cash. I can get anxious sometimes in new or overwhelming situations. I feel like I get drained easily through social interaction - I work full time with young children, so in my time off it’s important for me to kick it at home with my husband and recharge. Is anyone like me driving? I can do small talk and put on a social front, but after awhile I start to feel drained from being that person and have to stop driving sooner than I would like. I can get anxious for my trips - thinking about what to say, what kind of person is going to get in, if I’ll be able to find the place easily. I know I’m not the best suited for the job obviously but I’m not awkward and can do what I need to do. I’m just wondering if anyone is like me and what do you do to feel calm and more laid back about the experience? Uber is ideal because I can work as much or little as I want and when I want. I’m hoping as I get more used to it I’ll start to feel more comfortable and in control. Thanks!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/qylo1w/uber_driving_as_an_introvert_with_anxiety/

Also you get to have the same small talk conversation 30 times per day. Elsewhere in my life, I can just turn on the small talk any time I want. It’s great for my anxiety.  

I say “How’s your night going?” and they say “Pretty good how about yours?” and I say “Oh not too bad” and then if they don’t respond I’m done with conversation, and I turn up the music, and just drive.  

I am an introvert with a powerful need to recharge and Uber doesn’t drain me at all. It’s not real socializing so it doesn’t give me anxiety. What gives me social anxiety at work is trying to avoid the strange tensions that arise in long term social relationships and end up getting me fired.

My step daughter has ADHD and pretty crippling anxiety - much worse than I ever had, and I am the reclusive type. There's zero chance she could simply expose herself to that and work through it.

571,r2qqx3,12343736,Bye Uber!,uberdrivers,65.0,1,"I used Uber for the first time in my life in Vegas and now have 5 completed rides.  I was reading about Uber, since I’m a stockholder (I will be selling the stock too), I wanted the company to succeed and the drivers to succeed.  While reading, I learned there are passenger scores, PAX.   I decided to check my score and saw my score, it was 4.2.   Then I read what Uber drivers say what kind of passenger people below 4.6 are.  I read they are rude, loud, eating and leaving crumbs and garbage, slamming doors, multiple unscheduled stops, making drivers wait so on and so forth.  I am not that person. The only thing I can imagine that caused one out of those 5 drivers to give me a 1 star was when their earbuds in their trunk got caught on my jacket as I pulled my jacket from the trunk.  After I took my belongings the  driver closed the trunk and turned back towards the car when I heard a small sound and noticed the earbuds in the trunk had gotten caught on my jacket and had fallen to the pavement. I picked the earbuds up and called to the driver. He turned and I said, “here are your ear buds they got tangled”….I assumed he heard the same slight sound I did as he was almost as close so that is the only info I provided to him, again his back was to me.  He made a slight moan sound,popped the trunk and threw them in.  This guy seemed moody from the get g, never said hi when I said hi, never said a word after I said “thank you, have a good day”.  
I tipped all my drivers in the app 3 to 5 dollars for the 5 short rides all between 12 and  17. 00 and of course they all got 5stars.   I was traveling with my partner who was quiet the whole ride as well so it’s possible if it wasn’t the earbud driver it was someone who doesn’t like Gays.  
Anyway, back to the score.  This PAX score, especially the first 25 rides or so, in my opinion actually tells us as much about the particular driver the passenger ends up with than anything else especially for new passengers like myself.  After a hundred rides or so I’m sure it results in an accurate picture of the passenger but definitely below 25 rides or so it could be just a driver or two with bad attitudes annoyed by imagined rudeness. This 4.2 score actually has me depressed especially since I live my life treating others with respect in every way.  I have been dwelling on this for a week.  I never imagined a social media score could affect me like this but even at 59 I’m still learning about myself.  I’ve concluded I just need to be done with Uber.  I just can’t deal with the fact that even if an Uber drive shows up to pick up a lowly 4.2, I can’t deal with the preconceived opinions they will have of me and my partner.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/r2qqx3/bye_uber/

Another issue that is bothering me is Everywhere else in this world a 4 out of 5 rating would be above average, yet in Uberville someone with a  4.6 is perceived as a problem customer, or driver for that matter.

Second ride: 2.2 miles - 2.50$ (Taco Bell - hot food - 0$ tip)

If you factor in car depreciation, car payment, car insurance... I probably made like 1$/hr...

UberEats is an actual joke, I was having a blast seeing how absolute shit it was when you don't pass up 99% of all the orders. Anyone ordering from these places not tipping should take a look at this thread. I'm still in shock of how depressing it was. I can't imagine who in the world does this shit... sitting in a lobby of a McDonalds talking to some rich mom ask for ketchup packets, salt packets, and being attentive to all her needs. Getting her extra sauces for her little girls, 3 happy meals, blahblahblah... drive up to her rich ass neighborhood, hand it to her with a smile and see you got paid 2.50$

589,roin81,kanendd718,Drove a few hours today,uberdrivers,0.0,1,"Did a few rides today because I have nothing going on today for Christmas. Got some decent tips. A few of my passengers were early drunks today trying to cope on what should be a nice day, but I guess isn't for some of us. Overall, pretty depressing today dealing with my passengers, hopefully I was able to uplift them a bit by commiserating.  Anyway, merry Christmas folks it'll be over soon.
